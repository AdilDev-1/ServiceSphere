Design a full responsive UI layout for a web platform that allows users to submit service requests through structured forms and documents, then make payments after approval. This is not a car selling site — it is a CRM-style service platform. Build both user-facing and admin-facing screens. Use a clean, modern look with neutral colors and icons.

⚠️ Important: Do not include any backend logic, backend-related components, or functional workflows. Focus strictly on visual UI/UX mockups only. This project is for frontend design in Figma only

I want this as a fully visual UI prototype (not coded yet), like a mockup in Figma.
